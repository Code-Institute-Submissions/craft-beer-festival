## Testing

It tested continually as I developed it, in Firefox Developer and Chrome, 
using both Firefox and Chromium developer tools, and nearing the conclusion of 
the project also on other physical devices. Also before deployment i checked also in
Opera and Safari.
I used responsive mode in the dev tools and resizing the viewport to find unwanted 
behaviour so as to correct it. I also periodically checked the appearance on both my 
phone and tablet (both Android) in Chrome. 
I contiually tested code in the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
in order to get rid of errors. 
Testing my CSS in the [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) revealed few errors that I cloud indentify and fix.
